15. To find vowels and its count in a given string
16. To find character occurance fro the string
17. To find a first pair whose sum is zero
18. To find the largest pair of the 2 elements using indexing with unsorted elements
19. Finding a missing elements in an array and then add with existing elements. (-1 means 
    if elements not found then  it will return always -1 as per rule)
20. To find unique values from 2 arrays and keep into one array [1,2,3,4,4],[2,3,4,5,6]
21. Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three, 
    print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for the multiples of five, print "Buzz". 
    For numbers which are multiples of both three and five, print "FizzBuzz"

27. Unique values only from 2 arrays
28. Remove Duplicates from 2 arrays 
29. Sum of all numbers from start to end given number
30. Currying function i.e sum of multiple argument functions //inner function can access outer
    function variables but outer functions can't able to acceess inner function.
31. Find SUM, PRODUCT AND AVERAGE of the numbers //accumulation means collection
32. Reverse of a nuber using converting into string
