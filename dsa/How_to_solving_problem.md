OBJECTIVES
1.Define what an algorithm is
2.Devise a plan to solve algorithms
Compare and contrast problem solving
patterns including frequency counters, two
pointer problems and divide and conquer

Step 1 UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM

1. Can I restate the problem in my own words?
2. What are the inputs that go into the problem?
3. What are the outputs that should come from the
   solution to the problem?
4. Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words, do I have enough information to solve the problem? (You may not be able to answer this question until you set about solving the problem. That's okay; it's still worth considering the question at this early stage.)
5. How should I label the important pieces of data that area part of the problem?

Step 2 Concrete Examples
// Write a function which takes in a string and returns counts of each character in the string.
charCount("aaaa");
charCount("hello")
// {a:4}
// (h:1, e:1, 1:2, 0:1)
"my phone number is 182763"
"Hello hi"
charCount("")

Step 3 BREAK IT DOWN
Explicitly write out the steps you need to take.
This forces you to think about the code you'll write before you write it,
and helps you catch any lingering conceptual issues or misunderstandings
before you dive in and have to worry about details
(e.g. language syntax) as well.
